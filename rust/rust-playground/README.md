# Rust Playground
This program is created by `cargo new rust-playground`.

## Dev
Commands are run the top-level directory, i.e. "rust-playground".

Use `cargo doc` to generate docs in the _target_ directory.

Use `cargo build` to build the program. The program is stored as
_target/debug/rust-playground_.

Use `cargo run` to build and run the program in one command.

`cargo check` is to make sure your code compiles but it doesn't create an
executable.

## Deploy
`cargo build --release` to build an optimized binary in _target/release_.
