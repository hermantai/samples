Samples
#######

Templates and code snippets for various projects, so creating a new project
does not have to start from scratch

Go
**
For Go files with the `main` package, you can run the following to install it
in your $GOPATH::

  go get github.com/hermantai/samples/go/<directory-name-containing-the-file>

For example, if you want to try the "hello" script::

  go get github.com/hermantai/samples/go/hello

Then you would see the binary "hello" in the $GOPATH/bin directory.

Content of Go samples
=====================

base
  base is a basic demo of a Go program. This can be served as a template for
  other Go files.

  package stringutil. It's from the tutorial "How to Write Go Code" in
  https://golang.org/doc/code.html

  parser boilerplate.

sqlalchemy_project

web_client.py
  A simple command line web client. I know curl is the best, but doing it in
  python has much more fun!

Java

Misc
****
This README follows the convention mentioned in
http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html#headings and is
copied verbatim below::

  Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the
  structure is determined from the succession of headings. However, it is better
  to stick to the same convention throughout a project. For instance:

  # with overline, for parts
  * with overline, for chapters
  =, for sections
  -, for subsections
  ^, for subsubsections
  ", for paragraphs

Instead of differentiate betwee parts or sections, tho, I would just treat
them as h1, h2, h3..., so just use the symbols in that order.
