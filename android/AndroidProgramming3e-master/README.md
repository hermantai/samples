# Code Samples for 'Android Programming'

This repository contains the Java code samples used in the book [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (3rd Edition)](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming).

A long-term objective is to port all Java code to Kotlin.

Use Android Studio 3 (the Canary 8 preview or later).
