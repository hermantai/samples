#!/usr/bin/env python
"""A template for creating python scripts with subparsers. After parsing of the
command line arguments through the function parse_args, the whole application
control goes to the class App. Each subparser is handled by a
"<subcommand>_action" method of the App class. Usually, that method calls
another "<subcommand>" method to do the actual work (i.e. the business logic).
An example is a script called "git" with subcommands like "branch", "commit",
etc. There would be branch_action, commit_action ... methods to handle each
subcommand. They then use the methods "branch" or "commit" to do the actual
work. The idea is that the methods without the word "_action" should be
reusable outside of this console application (the script). That means those
methods should have minimum "user-friendly" printing, prompting, etc.

The template has a logger _log being ready. Another _plain_logger for text
without formatting. The reason of using a plain logger instead of "print" is
for skipping bufferng, which can be an issue if you redirect stdout to a file.
Notice that _log uses stderr while _plain_logger uses stdout by default.
_plain_error_logger is similar to _plain_logger but uses stderr.

Command line options of the script should be added to the parser of the
function parse_args.
