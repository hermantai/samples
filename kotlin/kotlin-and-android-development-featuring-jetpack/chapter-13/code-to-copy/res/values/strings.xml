    <string name="about_the_app_image_player_info"><p>All references to real people in the league are likely on purpose unless, of course, they\'re not. Player names were randomly generated when the league was created, plus there were some real friends, family, and colleagues added.\nAlso, there are a few real players, like <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/crookja01.shtml">Jack Crooks</a>, who somehow hit .213 in 1892 yet had a .400 OBP. Dude had 95 hits and 136 walks that season while slugging under .300. This may only be interesting to me and the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Hidden-Ball-Trick-Baseball-1876-1919/dp/1793996938/">Hidden Ball Trick</a> guys (thanks Jeremy and Jim for the discovery!).</p></string>
